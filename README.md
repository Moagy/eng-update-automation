# eng-update-automation
This is a project to automate generation of weekly updates within my organisation. I manually create weekly updates by reading off our DevOps board and reaching out to my engineering and data science colleagues. Phase one of this project is to automate 'reading' of our board and output the JSON into a notepad.


Phase 1 (essential):
Create a tool to read the DevOps board and generate an output into a notepade file on my desktop.

Phase 2 (eventual): 
Automate the sending of requesting updates from individuals.

Phase 3 (nice-to-have):
Merge that individual feedback with the board updates, layered with a natural language toolkit to generate whitty but informative weekly updates for the wider organisation.
