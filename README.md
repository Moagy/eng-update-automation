# eng-update-automation
This is a project to automate generation of weekly updates within my organisation. I manually create weekly updates by reading off our DevOps board and reaching out to my engineering and data science colleagues. Phase one of this project is to automate 'reading' of our board and output the JSON into a notepad.
